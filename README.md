# project-lessons-learned
Project developed as and exercise, part of my study at Trybe (1 year Full stack course) in may of 2021. It was my first running web site, it's super simple. I'd just used HTML and CSS in a very basic way but It marks a beginning of a long journey. I got really proud of it.
